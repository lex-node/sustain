                    -Blockchain network tokens are not primarily products, software licenses or currencies
                    (though they may secondarily have such functions), but shares of network equity. They are
                    subject to securities laws regulations, unless the network has become sufficiently
                    decentralized. Sufficient decentralization occurs when the tokens no longer represent
                    investment contracts and no single party or group of affiliated parties objectively controls
                    the network equity or means of block production on the network <br>

                    <br>
                    -Blockchain governance is best understood through the lens of <a
                        href="https://twitter.com/nickszabo4/status/1009996445280169985?lang=en">"Szabo's Governance
                    Trilemma"</a>.
                    According to Nick Szabo, blockchain governance generally takes one of the following three forms:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong style="color:yellow">ruthlessly minimized</strong></li>
                        <li><strong style="color:yellow">lord of the flies</strong></li>
                        <li><strong style="color:yellow">lawyers</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    Each horn of the trilemma has pros and cons. Ruthlessly minimized governance, sometimes described as
                    following "Szabo's Law", is the most robust against certain forms of social capture. However, when
                    minimized governance is not desired or possible, my position is that legalistic governance is
                    preferable to lord-of-the-flies governance. If a network will be subject to frequent hardforks
                    which adversely affect minorities, due process is required and legalistic governance becomes
                    particularly important.
