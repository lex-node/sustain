                                On-Chain Governance by Vlad Zamfir</a></li>
                            <p>tldr: On-chain governance means that blockchain nodes automatically upgrade when an
                                on-chain governance process decides on an upgrade. Off-chain governance is better
                                because node operators must consciously decide whether to install a hard fork and thus
                                they are necessary participants in governance. On-chain governance moots node operator
                                participation. Thus, with on-chain governance an important check on developer and
                                tokenholder power is lost. Users !== token holders, their interests may diverge, and in
                                general blockchains should benefit the public in general, not merely token holders. Thus
                                plutocracy based on token ownership is undesirable. </p>

                            <p>tldr: "[A]rgue[s] hat "tightly coupled" on-chain voting is overrated, the status quo of
                                "informal governance" as practiced by Bitcoin [and] Ethereum...is much less bad than
                                commonly thought, that people who think that the purpose of blockchains is to completely
                                expunge soft mushy human intuitions and feelings in favor of completely algorithmic
                                governance (emphasis on "completely") are absolutely crazy, and loosely coupled voting
                                as done by Carbonvotes and similar systems is underrated, as well as describe what
                                framework should be used when thinking about blockchain governance in the first
                                place." </p>

                            <p>tldr: There is a dilemma for miners on blockchain networks with scripting capabilties â€”
                                whether to verify
                                the validity of scripted transactions or accept them without verification. Verifying
                                scripts consumes computation resources and therefore
                                delays honest miners in the race to mine the next block. This dilemma leaves open the
                                possibility of attacks which result in unverified transactions on the
                                blockchain. This means that some computation tasks outsourced to cryptocurrency-based
                                consensus computers may not execute correctly</p>

                            <p>tldr: Ethereum miners have sufficient selfish incentive to refrain from setting a high gaslimit that blocks will not take very long to verify and the verifier's dilemma will not kick in.</p>
