                            <p>"Blockchain governance" generally comes in only three varieties: (1) Lord of the Flies,
                                (2) lawyers, or (3) ruthlessly minimized.</p>

                                On-Chain Governance by Vlad Zamfir</a></li>
                            <p>On-chain governance means that blockchain nodes automatically upgrade when an
                                on-chain governance process decides on an upgrade. Off-chain governance requires node
                                operators to consciously decide whether to install a hard fork; thus,
                                node operators are necessary participants in off-chain governance. On-chain governance
                                moots node operator
                                participation. Thus, with on-chain governance an important check on developer and
                                tokenholder power is lost. Users !== token holders, their interests may diverge, and in
                                general blockchains should benefit the public at large, not merely token holders. Thus,
                                plutocracy based on token ownership is undesirable. </p>

                            <p>Blockchain governance is not really a decision function, but a set of coordination
                                mechanisms. Multifactorial consensus, including but not limited to non-binding
                                tokenholder voting, is superior to both binding tokenholder voting and core developer
                                consensus without tokenholder voting. Binding tokenholder voting suffers from several
                                problems, including extra costs of minority forking, low participation, bribery attacks
                                and lack of representation of non-plutocratic interests. Digital constitutions do not
                                sufficiently mitigate these issues with voting because norms are not reducible to simple
                                edicts.</p>

                            <p>tldr: There is a dilemma for miners on blockchain networks with scripting capabilties â€”
                                whether to verify
                                the validity of scripted transactions or accept them without verification. Verifying
                                scripts consumes computation resources and therefore
                                delays honest miners in the race to mine the next block. This dilemma leaves open the
                                possibility of attacks which result in unverified transactions on the
                                blockchain. This means that some computation tasks outsourced to cryptocurrency-based
                                consensus computers may not execute correctly</p>
